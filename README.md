  - This file contains mock user interfaces designed for the VeriTax platform.
  - It includes wireframes and prototype designs that help visualize the user experience and interface layout.

- **[Class Diagram and ERD](https://github.com/Anonto050/CSE-326-ISD-Sessional/blob/main/Class%20Diagram%20and%20ERD.pdf)**
  - This file includes the class diagram and Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) for the VeriTax system.
  - These diagrams provide a visual representation of the system's data structure and relationships between different entities.

- **[Collaboration Diagram](https://github.com/Anonto050/CSE-326-ISD-Sessional/blob/main/Collaboration%20Diagram.pdf)**
  - This file contains collaboration diagrams that illustrate the interactions between objects in the VeriTax system.
  - The diagrams help understand how objects work together to achieve specific system functions.

- **[Sequence Diagram](https://github.com/Anonto050/CSE-326-ISD-Sessional/blob/main/Sequence%20Diagram.pdf)**
  - This file includes sequence diagrams that show the sequence of messages and interactions between objects in the system.
  - The diagrams provide a detailed view of the order in which operations are carried out.

- **[State Diagram](https://github.com/Anonto050/CSE-326-ISD-Sessional/blob/main/State%20Diagram.pdf)**
